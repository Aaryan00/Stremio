### `Process for Setting up the project locally`

Hello, My Friends  
Thank you for having interest in this repository !

To use this application,

1. put mongoDB info into dev.js and prod.js file
2. Type " npm install " inside the root directory ( Download Server Dependencies )
3. Type " npm install " inside the client directory ( Download Front-end Dependencies )
4. Create cloud on Clodinary and put the cloud info in server/routes/video and server/route/users
5. Create project on google Oauth and put the CLIENT_ID in client/src/components/keys or remove the Google Login from Register And login page if you want to skip this step.
6. Add your gmail credentials in server/Nodemailer/mail
7. Run "npm run dev" inside root directory to run the project.
If you have problem, feel free to ask me:)
Any kind of improvement of suggestion is most welcome
